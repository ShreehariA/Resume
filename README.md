# Resume
A place for my LaTeX resumes

## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a typesetting system commonly used for technical and scientific documentation. It allows users to create professionally formatted documents with ease. LaTeX is particularly useful for documents that contain complex mathematical equations, tables, and references. It is widely used in academia, research, and publishing.

## Why LaTeX was used in this repository

LaTeX was used in this repository to create a well-structured and professionally formatted resume. The `resume.tex` file demonstrates the use of LaTeX for formatting and structuring the resume content. LaTeX provides precise control over the layout and appearance of the document, making it an ideal choice for creating resumes.
